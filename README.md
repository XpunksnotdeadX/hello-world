# Hello World
# I'm currently working on an animal quiz coded in the language python, but I've been having some trouble.
# Whenever I enter the correct answer to a question, it says; Correct answer! Sorry, wrong answer.
# When I enter the wrong answer, it only says Sorry,  wrong answer.
# The quiz is also supposed to give you 3 lives for each question, but no luck.
# This code is an exercise from the coding book, "Coding Projects in Python" and this isn't the first time the book's had errors.
# Just incase the code's outdated, the book came out in June 2017, which I don't think is too old.
# Thank you to anyone and everyone who's willing to help!
